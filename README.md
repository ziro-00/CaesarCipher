# Caesar Cipher GUI

This is a simple Python program that implements a Caesar Cipher with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. The program can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher technique and also includes a brute force feature for decryption.

## Features
- Encryption and decryption of text, using the Caesar Cipher.
- Brute force decryption capability for Caesar Cipher-encrypted text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ziro-00/CaesarCipher.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd caesar-cipher-gui
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` file:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The GUI window will appear.
3. Enter a phrase and the shift amount in the provided fields.
4. Click the "Encrypt/Decrypt" button to see the encrypted and decrypted results.
5. Click the "Bruteforce" button to perform a brute force on the encrypted text.

## Examples
- Encryption/Decryption:

    ```
    Enter a phrase: Hello
    Enter the shift amount: 3
    Plaintext: Hello
    Encrypted: Khoor
    Decrypted: Hello
    ```

- Bruteforce:

    ```
    Enter a phrase: Khoor
    ... (output for all shifts)
    ```
